# 🎲 Pokémon/Trainer Generator Module

This is my first module. I built it because sometimes I’m not so quick at coming up with something on the spot when players do completely random things. With this generator, I can improvise much more easily.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Open the menu**  
2. **Select your rank**  
   - The maximum rank is **Ace**.  
   - If you need something more advanced like **Master** or **Champion**, it’s better to create those manually.  
3. **Drop your actor**  
   - Preferably a **Pokémon**.  
   - It also works with **Trainer NPCs**, but requires some adjustments with the special attribute.  
4. **Generate your Pokémon/Trainer** 🎉

## 📌 Notes

- This module is designed to help with quick improvisation during roleplay sessions.  
- It works with both Pokémon and Trainer actors, though Trainers may need extra customization.  
- The goal is to have instant resources ready when players do something unexpected.

## 🛠️ Project Status

This is the **first module** of the generator. I plan to keep improving it and add more options in the future.
